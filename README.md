Privacy is important to keep people from spying on your sensitive data and to preserve the integrity of your files. When you encrypt your zip archive, your data will be secure from sender for decryption. Encryption keeps your messages in tact and safe from modification during transmission.

This solution can protect your files on any computer, network, or device. The more secure encryption algorithm works locally in your web browser and protects your documents using the industry standard AES algorithm with the most secure hashing. Every message is authenticated to be safe from malware and modification.

## How it works
User A creates a password to encrypt a file using this client-side mechanism - which produces a self-decrypting HTML file. User B opens this HTML file in their browser which will ask them for the password to decrypt the file allowing them to download the original file all without a server. The homepage can be downloaded and self-hosted at will.
